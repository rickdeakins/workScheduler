# workScheduler

## User Story

As a user I want to utilize a planner application for which I can document my daily tasks to manage my time in an effective way.

## Functionality

The application will provide hourly timeblocks for the typical work day starting at 8:00am and ending at 5:00pm. The text areas will dynamically update by color based on the current hour based on the past, present and future times.
The current date will generate at the top of the screen for reference of the current date.
When the data entered by the user is saved via the save button, the user data is stored in the local storage. Once the browser is refreshed, the user data is retained in the text area.

## Comments

This project was a good challenge that required extensive research for me, specifically for my user input to stay in the text area as I refreshed the browser. Between BCS Xpert Learning Assistant, a variety of forums and google searches as well as tutoring sessons, I was able to complete this challenge with a functional application.
